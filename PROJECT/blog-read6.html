          <h1>Interior Design Mistakes to Avoid</h1>
          <p>When it comes to interior design, there are a few common mistakes that can disrupt the overall aesthetic and functionality of a space. One of the biggest errors is overcrowding a room with too much furniture or decor, which can make the space feel cramped and overwhelming. Another mistake is neglecting proper lighting – relying solely on overhead lighting instead of using a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting can create harsh, unflattering environments. It's also important to consider scale and proportion; choosing furniture that’s too large or small for a room can throw off the balance. Additionally, sticking to one color palette without incorporating variety can make a space feel flat and lifeless. Lastly, ignoring the importance of flow and functionality can lead to spaces that look beautiful but aren't practical for everyday living. Avoiding these mistakes ensures a more harmonious, inviting, and usable space.</p>
