          <h1>Budget-Friendly Interior Design Hacks</h1>
          <p>Creating a stylish home on a budget is entirely possible with a few clever interior design hacks. Start by focusing on small, impactful changes, like swapping out old hardware on cabinets and doors for something more modern or adding peel-and-stick wallpaper to a feature wall for a quick, affordable update. Furniture doesn’t have to be expensive; consider thrift stores, secondhand shops, or even online marketplaces for hidden gems that can be easily revamped with a fresh coat of paint or new upholstery. If you’re looking to update your space without a full overhaul, focus on accessories like throw pillows, rugs, and art prints, which can transform a room without breaking the bank. DIY projects, such as repurposing wooden crates into shelving or creating your own art pieces, add a personal touch and are budget-friendly. Lastly, maximize natural light by keeping window treatments minimal, which not only makes your space feel brighter but also more open and airy. With a little creativity and resourcefulness, you can refresh your home in a way that’s both stylish and affordable.</p>
